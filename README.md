I designed and developed an Interview Preparation App with a focus on enhancing the user experience (UI/UX). The app includes essential features such as login, signup, logout, and password recovery screens, ensuring secure access for users. It offers a range of functionalities, including resume building, mock interviews, coding profiles, recruitment updates, career guidance, and company-specific quizzes. By leveraging my expertise in frontend development, I successfully created an intuitive and user-friendly interface to aid individuals in preparing for interviews effectively and efficiently.
